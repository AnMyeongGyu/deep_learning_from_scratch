When it comes to studying, the "S" stands for study. Specifically, "1S" represents the initial reading of a book or material, while "2S" indicates the second reading.

On the other hand, "R" stands for chapter review. Each time you review a chapter, you can add a number next to the "R" to show how many times you have reviewed it. For example, "R1" means you have reviewed the chapter once, and "R2" indicates that you have reviewed it twice.

This system helps you monitor your progress and the number of times you have gone through the material. By combining readings (1S, 2S) and chapter reviews (R1, R2), you can create an organized study plan to strengthen your understanding and remember the subject matter better.
